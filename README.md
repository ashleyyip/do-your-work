# Do Your Work Chrome Extension

A personal project designed to keep me on track by ensuring I see all my tasks every time I open a new tab in Chrome.

Features:
- Animated lists that pop up so I can run my mouse over them aimlessly
- Ability to cross off tasks so I can feel productive
- Ability to delete tasks so I can pretend they don't exist
- Different community-generated colour schemes (scraped from colourlovers.com) with each reload

I tried to apply the patterns and best practices learned in my CS courses through development of this Chrome extension, while still making something fun, useful, and relatable.
